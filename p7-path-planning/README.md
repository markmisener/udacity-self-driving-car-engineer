# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Model Documentation
For this project, we were provided with nearly all the necessary components to simulate a self-driving car making it's way around a
highway with other cars. The only missing piece was the path planner. This section details the path planning model.

#### Overview

The output of the path planning model is a series of (x, y) points along a map. The duration between points in 0.2 seconds.
A successfully planned path should follow these simple rules to ensure the vehicle:
- Will not exceed 50 MPH
- Will not exceed a total acceleration of 10 m/s^2
- Will not exceed a jerk of 10 m/s^3
- Will not come into contact with any of the other cars on the road
- Will not spend more than a 3 second length out side the lane lanes during changing lanes, and every other time the car stays inside one of the 3 lanes on the right hand side of the road.

#### Rubric points
- **The car drives according to the speed limit**
  The vehicle's current speed is stored in a variable `ref_vel`, which is used while determining whether to speed up, slow down, or change lanes.

- **Max acceleration and jerk are not exceeded.**
  The vehicle starts and an initial velocity of 0, and gradually speeds up and slows down do avoid exceeding a total acceleration of 10 m/s^2 and a jerk of 10 m/s^3

- **Car does not have collisions.**
  Assuming other vehicles drive in an expected manor, the major collisions we must look out for are read-ending the car ahead in the same lane or colliding with a car in the next lane over while changing lanes. Both types of collisions are mitigated through the use of sensor fusion data. The model loops through all objects detected through sensor fusion, checking each detection to understand which lane it is in and where it will be by the time the vehicle reaches it. If the detected object is in the same lane, the model determines if there are other objects in the neighboring lanes, and makes a lane change if safe to do so. If it is unsafe, the vehicle will gradually slow down.

- **The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.**
  The vehicle is able to keep its lane through understanding the width of each lane, generating future waypoints, and interpolating additional points
  between the future waypoints. The future waypoints are created using Frenet coordinates at set intervals (30m, 60m 90m). Using Frenet coordinates in this
  case makes it much easier to work with than euclidean coordinates. Using a spline, we are able to interpolate the remaining points needed to create a
  smooth trajectory for our vehicle.


- **The car is able to change lanes**
  If the vehicle nears a detected object in the same lane, the model will determine if the neighboring lanes are clear to merge into. If the lane is clear,
  we set our `lane` variable equal to the value of the lane the vehicle should merge into. The `lane` variable is then used while creating our future way points,
  allowing us to again use the spline to create a smooth trajectory for a lane change.


### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time.

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
